## Research Publications

### [Why Stop at One Error? Benchmarking LLMs as Data Science Code Debuggers for Multi-Hop and Multi-Bug Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22388) - preprint (First Author)
- **Authors:** **Zhiyu Yang**, Shuo Wang, Yukun Yan, Yang Deng.
- **Summary:** Introduced DSDBench, a challenging benchmark built via an automated framework to test LLMs on realistic data science code with multiple, multi-hop bugs. Our findings reveal that even top models  struggle to trace error origins and achieve complete bug detection, exposing a critical gap in their reasoning and debugging capabilities.
- **Contribution:** I designed the DSDBench dataset construction pipeline, implemented the automated error injection framework, and conducted experiments to evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, revealing critical performance gaps in dynamic debugging.

### [MatPlotAgent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11453) - ACL 2024 Findings (First Author)
- **Authors:** **Zhiyu Yang**, Zihan Zhou, Shuo Wang, Xin Cong, Xu Han, Yukun Yan, Zhenghao Liu, Zhixing Tan, Pengyuan Liu, Dong Yu, Zhiyuan Liu, Xiaodong Shi, Maosong Sun.
- **Summary:** Introduced MatPlotBench for automatic evaluation of AI methods for scientific data visualization. Proposed MatPlotAgent, a framework using visual feedback to enhance LLM performance.
- **Contribution:** Designed the agent framework and evaluation method, conducted experiments, and curated data for MatPlotBench.

### [UltraLink](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04588) - ACL 2024 (Fifth Author)
- **Authors:** Haoyu Wang, Shuo Wang, Yukun Yan, Xujia Wang, **Zhiyu Yang**, Yuzhuang Xu, Zhenghao Liu, Liner Yang, Ning Ding, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun.
- **Summary:** Developed a multilingual SFT dataset with language-specific and language-agnostic subsets using knowledge-enhanced data augmentation methods with Wikipedia as knowledge source.
- **Contribution:** Concretized the paper's idea, designed initial prompt templates for data synthesis, and revised the paper.

### [Enhancing Free-Form Table Question Answering Models by Distilling Relevant-Cell-Based Rationales](https://aclanthology.org/2024.ccl-1.75/) - CCL 2024 (First Author)
- **Authors:** **Zhiyu Yang**, Shuo Wang, Yukun Yan, Pengyuan Liu, Dong Yu.
- **Summary:** Proposed a knowledge distillation method for table QA tasks using relevant-cell-based rationales, achieving SOTA results on the FeTaQA benchmark.
- **Contribution:** Developed the distillation method, conducted experiments, and authored the paper.
